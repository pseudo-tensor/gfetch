# Github-Fetcher (gfetch)
### What is gfetch?
Github-Fetcher or gfetch is an extension for chrome that lets you view all the issues and PRs of all the repositories of a single org/individual.
### Why gfetch?
Often, it becomes difficult for us to keep switching between multiple repositories inside a Github account. Tools like CLI and the Github Search do provide a solution but it's not very neat.
This extension provides a GUI to view all the issues and PRs of all repositories while inside any page of that Github account.
